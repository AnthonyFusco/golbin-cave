* Goblin cave

the player input makes the game tick
no game engine

dropped into a cave, injured with nothing in the dark
inspi from barbarian
text interface
maybe you're a goblin, then you can own part of the cave
magic is a programming game, fn composition, maybe can teach func programming
live coding
martial is ?
monster faction and human faction

** MVP
control using fns
move in dungeon
change boolean like a switch, triggers an event, a door is now open
think about battles

more like dwarf fortress
goblins are programmable
your main char can dwelve manually
resources to collect, miners to code
eclairers to code
each new goblin gives you more processing power
queries are question you formulate to the world, enabling to use the data to build behavior
golbins are individual but share a mind link to the leader
this link enables more magic for the leader
